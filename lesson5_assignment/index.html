        <h2> Examining Social Media Virality</h2>
     
     <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
        <p> Over the past decade, a new type of fame has arose. 
        A fame that is perhaps more influential than that of athletes, musicians, and actors.
        A fame that is aquired by seemingly normal people, people who don't always have discernable 
        talents or unique characteristics. I am speaking about internet fame.
        Social media has propelled regular people from all walks of life into stardom.
        Going "viral" has become the new age equivalent of winning an Academy Award.</p>
        
    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <p> To non-millenials, garnering internet fame may still seem like something that holds no weight.
        For young people, especially teenagers, going viral or becoming a social media star is like winning the lottery.
        The power and influence social media gives regular people is unlike anything else in history.
        Although there are seemingly hundreds of bloggers, vloggers and influencers in the world today,
        becoming famous online is no simple task.</p>
        
    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <p> According to Forbes.com, "5 billion items are posted each day to Facebook". How does an aspiring social media superstar 
        get noticed among all of that noise? Oftentimes it seems that many of the people who go viral on the internet did not intend 
        for this sudden surge of fame to take place. In fact, a YouGov Omnibus survey shared that nearly half of Americans would
        not like to go viral on social media or become famous on the news for a short time.</p>
        
    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
        <p>Individuals who are adored and recognized online may seem to be living the life. They post pictures of adventurous vacations, extravagant dinners, 
        and parties with fellow celebrities. But the content that is posted by that social media 
        influencer represents snippets of their life. In actuality, many internet celebrities have trouble handling their rapid fame and oftentimes, rapid fall from grace.
        An aritlce from TheFederalist.com states that the stories of many internet royals are marked by 
        loneliness and a struggle against the image they’ve created for themselves. Sometimes things aren't always as wonderful as they seem through the screen of our cellphones. </p>
